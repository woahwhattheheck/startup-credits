Every tool has two prices. The one on the pricing page, and the one startups
actually pay once somebody tells them the program exists.

The second price isn't a secret. It's just spread across a few hundred vendor
pages, worded differently every time, and quietly revised whenever the vendor
feels like it. So we write it down. One file per Entity, every fact carrying the
page it came from and the day we read it. Published companies appear in
[Sourcey](https://sourcey.com/companies), alongside their offers, capabilities,
assessments and evidence.

Nothing here is for sale. Tiers come from evidence and are never influenced by
payment, and the [rules](https://sourcey.com/policies) are published as catalog
records with their own revision digests, exactly like the data they govern.

## What a record looks like

```yaml
# entities/at/atlassian.yaml
schema_version: sourcey.entity-authoring/v1alpha1
entity:
  entity_id: ent_…
  slug: atlassian
  slug_aliases: []
  name: Atlassian
  domains:
    - value: atlassian.com
      role: primary
      valid_from: 2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z
  category: productivity
profile:
  summary: Collaboration and developer tools for software teams.
  description: Atlassian makes collaboration and developer tools for software teams.
  links:
    site: https://www.atlassian.com/
sources:
  - source_id: src_0ae96c1d…
    url: https://www.atlassian.com/software/startups
offers:
  - title: Atlassian for Startups
    summary: Eligible startups can get Atlassian Cloud products (including Premium
      editions of Jira, Confluence, Loom, Bitbucket, and more) for $0 for 12 months
      for up to 50 users.
    eligibility:
      statement: Must not be an existing Atlassian paid customer, must be VC funded
        or associated with a partner accelerator/incubator, and must not have raised
        more than $10 million in external funding.
```

Eligibility conditions are represented explicitly rather than hidden in a
marketing summary, and every factual value traces back to material at the URL
in `sources`. Neutral Sourcey prose may faithfully summarize those cited facts;
it is not presented as a vendor quotation.

## Getting it

Browse it at [sourcey.com/startup-credits](https://sourcey.com/startup-credits), by record or by category. Or ask
for one record and get that same offer back:

```sh
curl -s https://api.sourcey.com/v1/entities/by-slug/atlassian \
  | jq -r '.data.offers[0].summary'
```

> Eligible startups can get Atlassian Cloud products (including Premium editions
> of Jira, Confluence, Loom, Bitbucket, and more) for $0 for 12 months for up to
> 50 users.

No key and no signup, for you or for your agents. There is an
[OpenAPI](https://api.sourcey.com/openapi.yml) surface, an
[MCP server](https://mcp.sourcey.com/mcp) for assistants, a
[change feed](https://sourcey.com/changes.ndjson) for watching terms move,
[llms.txt](https://sourcey.com/llms.txt) for models, and a
[guide](https://sourcey.com/SKILL.md) for agents working the data directly.

Terms move. Confirm with the vendor before you rely on it.

Facts are [CC BY 4.0](DATA-LICENSE.md) and training on them is welcome. Quote the
`offer_id` and `revision_digest` and your citation still means something after
the offer moves:

    sourcey.com · <offer_id> @ <revision_digest> · CC BY 4.0

## Fixing or adding one

Copy a nearby file under `entities/`, keep the shape, open a pull request. CI
checks only what you changed and hands back real field errors, so you can push
corrections without waiting on a maintainer.

Two rules carry most of the weight. Every fact needs public supporting material
at a URL in `sources`, and if the source does not substantiate it, it does not go
in. Guessed amounts and invented eligibility read exactly like checked ones,
which is why they get closed. Sourcey-written titles, summaries, descriptions,
and taxonomy labels may use neutral wording, but they still need cited factual
support. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the rest, including a preflight
that runs the same verifier CI uses. Correcting a stale offer is worth as much as
adding a new one.

## If it's your company

Claim it and the record carries your signature instead of our reading of your
page. Prove the domain whichever way suits you: DNS, a file on your site, a role
address, or a reply from any mailbox on your domain. Claiming establishes who you
are and never signs your offers for you; you attest to those separately, by exact
revision.

Free, now and later. Start at `sourcey.com/claim/<your-slug>`.
